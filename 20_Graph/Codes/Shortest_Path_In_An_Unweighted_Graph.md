# Question : [Shortest Path In An Unweighted Graph - CodingNinja](https://www.naukri.com/code360/problems/shortest-path-in-an-unweighted-graph_981297)

***Problem statement***
The city of Ninjaland is analogous to the unweighted graph. The city has ‘N’ houses numbered from 1 to ‘N’ respectively and are connected by M bidirectional roads. If a road is connecting two houses ‘X’ and ‘Y’ which means you can go from ‘X’ to ‘Y’ or ‘Y’ to ‘X’. It is guaranteed that you can reach any house from any other house via some combination of roads. Two houses are directly connected by at max one road.

A path between house ‘S’ to house ‘T’ is defined as a sequence of vertices from ‘S’ to ‘T’. Where starting house is ‘S’ and the ending house is ‘T’ and there is a road connecting two consecutive houses. Basically, the path looks like this: (S , h1 , h2 , h3 , ... T). you have to find the shortest path from ‘S’ to ‘T’.

***For example***
In the below map of Ninjaland let say you want to go from S=1 to T=8, the shortest path is (1, 3, 8). You can also go from S=1 to T=8  via (1, 2, 5, 8)  or (1, 4, 6, 7, 8) but these paths are not shortest.

### Your task
You don't need to print or input anything.

### Constraints
`1 <= T <= 100`
`2 <= N <= 10^3`
`1 <= M <= min( N *(N - 1) / 2 , 1000 )`
`1 <= S, T <= N`

## Solution

```Cpp

Using BFS Traversal :

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestPath(vector<pair<int, int>> edges, int N, int M, int src, int dest) {

        // Create an adjacency list to represent the graph
        vector<int> adj[N];

        // Iterate over all edges to populate the adjacency list, converting to 0-based indexing
        for(int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            int u = edges[i].first;         // Start vertex of the edge
            int v = edges[i].second;        // End vertex of the edge
            adj[u - 1].push_back(v - 1);    // Add v to the list of adjacent vertices of u
            adj[v - 1].push_back(u - 1);    // Since the graph is undirected, add u to the list of adjacent vertices of v
        }
        
        // Convert source and destination to 0-based indexing
        src--;
        dest--;

        // Initialize the visited vector to keep track of visited nodes
        vector<bool> visited(N, false);
        
        // Initialize the parent vector to reconstruct the path
        vector<int> parent(N, -1);

        // Create a queue for BFS (Breadth-First Search)
        queue<int> q;

        // Start BFS from the source node
        q.push(src);            // Enqueue the source node
        visited[src] = true;    // Mark the source node as visited

        // Perform BFS
        while(!q.empty()) {
            int frontNode = q.front();      // Get the front node from the queue
            q.pop();                        // Dequeue the front node

            // Iterate over all the neighbors of the current node
            for(auto nbrNode : adj[frontNode]) {
                if(visited[nbrNode])        // If the neighbor has already been visited, skip it
                    continue;
                else {
                    // If the neighbor hasn't been visited:
                    visited[nbrNode] = true;         // Mark it as visited
                    q.push(nbrNode);                 // Enqueue the neighbor
                    parent[nbrNode] = frontNode;     // Set the parent of the neighbor to reconstruct the path later
                }
            }
        }

        // Reconstruct the path from destination to source using the parent vector
        vector<int> path;
        while(dest != -1) {
            path.push_back(dest + 1);       // Convert back to 1-based indexing
            dest = parent[dest];            // Move to the parent node
        }

        // Reverse the path to get it from source to destination
        reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
        return path;                        // Return the reconstructed path
    }
};

Time Complexity = O(V + E)
Space Complexity = O(V + E)
