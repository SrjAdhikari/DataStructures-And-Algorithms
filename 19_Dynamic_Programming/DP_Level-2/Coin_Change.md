# Question : [Coin Change - (LeetCode : 322)](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/)

You are given an integer array coins representing `coins` of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

### Example 1

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

### Example 2

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

### Example 3

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

### Constraints

-   `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
-   `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
-   `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

### Recursive Approach

```Cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {

    }
};

Time Complexity = O(2^n)
Space Complexity = O(n)
```

### Top-Down (Memoization) Approach

```Cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        
    }
};

Time Complexity = O(2^n)
Space Complexity = O(n)
```

### Bottom-Up (Tabulation) Approach

```Cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        
    }
};

Time Complexity = O(2^n)
Space Complexity = O(n)
```

### Space Optimized Approach

```Cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        
    }
};

Time Complexity = O(2^n)
Space Complexity = O(n)
```
